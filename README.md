# Library_project
A python project that uses a sql database for a library
This is a project i did about a year ago, and now i decided to upload it.

This project contains two main directories:
1. sql_server/

This directory includes all the necessary files to initialize and set up a SQL Server instance on your local system.
2. python_gui/

This directory contains three files:

    A standard Python script (.py)

    A Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)

    An executable Python file

All three files implement the same Python GUI application built using Tkinter, and they are connected to the SQL Server using the pymssql library.
